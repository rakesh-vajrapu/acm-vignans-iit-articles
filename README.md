Here's a recommended structure for articles you write:

**Article Folder Structure:**

- `article-name` (Folder)
    - `article.md` (Markdown file containing the article content)
    - `author.md` (Optional markdown file with author details)

**Article (article.md):**

```md

## Introduction

Write your article in markdown syntax. Alternatively, create it in a word processor and use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to convert it to markdown formatting.

**Key Points:**

- **Concise Article Titles:** Choose titles that accurately reflect the content and are easy to understand.
- **Descriptive Descriptions:** Capture the main ideas of the article without giving away everything.
- **Author Name:** Specify your full name.
- **Date:** Include the creation or last updated date.
- **Tags (Optional):** Add relevant keywords for discoverability.
```

**Author details (author.md):** (Optional - include if desired)
